## Glossary

code golf

: An approach to problem-solving in programming in which the quality of a solution---assuming it satisfies the functional requirements---is assessed almost entirely by code brevity, rather than by runtime efficiency, code clarity, etc.

minimum-threshold programming test

: A relatively simple programming test, intended to weed out candidates who don't yet have the skills necessary for an entry-level programming position.
